A simple website built using Vue, Nuxt, Nuxt UI v3, Tailwind v4 and Pinia

I wanted a place where I can show some pages and components that I have built. Currently it is very minimal.

The components are mostly prototypes and are not fully-functional or incredibly robust. There is no backend for the moment. I might add some basic NoSQL db like Cosmos at a later date.

The website is deployed to Azure Static Web Apps at https://blue-pebble-0e93d0b03.4.azurestaticapps.net/

Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions.
